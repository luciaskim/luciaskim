## Why nested routes?
Nested routes allows a cleaner user experience. The path to the file is illustrated in the url. Having the category in the url would organise my blog. 


My blog needs to have the route form `pages/[category]/[id].js`. Furthermore, I would like to have the category dynamically created from the frontmatter.


## Dynamic directory routing: step by step

### Create a `[category]` directory in `/pages`
Next.js renders the blog content from the `/pages` directory. To create a subroute, create a new directory inside the `/pages` directory. Because the content of the category is changed, I need to use square brackets `[]` to indicate dynamic routes.

In order for the dynamic folder to function properly, the `category` must be proviede in the params of `getStaticPaths()`.


### Create `getAllPostPaths()` function
The function provides data to `getStaticPaths()`. I need to supply the category from the frontmatter to create the dynamic route.

The original function `getAllPostIds` outputs:
```
[
  { params: { id: 'how-i-built-my-blog' } },
  { params: { id: 'nested-routes-for-next-js' } }
]
```


I created a new function 'getAllPostPaths()' so that the category is included in the params. When `matter(filpath)`, JSON data is returned so that the content and front matter are separated. The front matter under `data`. To use aspects of the frontmatter, we need to look inside `data`.
```
\\ \lib\posts.js
export function getAllPostPaths() {
  // Creates an array of object that has a params key
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  return fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    const id = fileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, '');
    // Read markdown file as string
    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, fileName);
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');

    // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
    const matterResult = matter(fileContents);
    const category = matterResult.data.category
    return {
      params: {
        id,
        category
      },
    };
  });
}
```

Restart the development server so that the function can be imported.

### Update `getStaticPaths()`
I first moved the `[id].js` file to the `[category]` directory. Then I imported `getAllPostPaths()` and updated the `getStaticPaths()` function.
```
\\ \pages\[category]\[id].js

import React, { useMemo } from "react";
import { getMDXComponent } from "mdx-bundler/client";
import { getAllPostPaths, getPostData } from "../../lib/posts";
import Date from "../../components/date";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getAllPostPaths();
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

`getStaticProps()` do not need to be changes as the id is used to generate the page.


### Updated links on `\index.js`

I need to include the category in the links so that the pages are correctly routed.

```
\\ \index.js
<section>
  <ul>
    {allPostsData.map(({ id, category, publishedAt, title }) => (
      <li key={id}>
        <Link href={`/${category}/${id}`}>{title}</Link>
        <br />
        <small>
          <Date dateString={publishedAt} />
        </small>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
</section>

```

**React Tutorials**
Here are the tutorials on nested routes for React.

Has a separate directory for each category.

```js
const glob = require('glob');

glob('posts/**/*.md', (err, files) => {
    console.log({files});

    /*
     * will produce:
     * {
     *     files: [
     *       'posts/CategoryOne/markdown-one-1.md',
     *       'posts/CategoryOne/markdown-one-2.md',
     *       'posts/CategoryOne/markdown-one-3.md',
     *       'posts/CategoryTwo/markdown-two-1.md',
     *       'posts/CategoryTwo/markdown-two-2.md',
     *       'posts/CategoryTwo/markdown-two-3.md'
     *     ]
     * }
     */
